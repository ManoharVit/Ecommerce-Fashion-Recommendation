# Personalized-Fashion-Recommendation
Based on past interactions with customer and product metadata, including product description and appearance, recommend 12 products that are quite relevant to the customer.

## Introduction

Kaggle H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations competition, where the challenge was to build a recommendation engine to predict which articles a customer would buy in a particular week starting on September 23, 2020.

As Yuval Noah Harari points out in "Homo Deus," the same mathematical laws apply to both biochemical and electronic algorithms. This project aims to represent human decision-making processes as algorithms that process multidimensional input information and generate outputs in the form of decisions.

## Recommendations Everywhere

Recommendations have become integral to our daily lives, whether it's Spotify creating personalized playlists or Netflix suggesting TV series and movies. Similarly, H&M aims to save customers time by providing personalized clothing recommendations.

### Example Scenario: Emily's Decision-Making Process

1. **Need Identification**: Emily realizes she needs a new jacket for a cold evening out with friends.
2. **Search and Evaluation**: She browses H&M's online store and decides she prefers a coat over a jacket.
3. **Style and Preference**: Emily's style influences her decision, and she chooses a classic, cream coat within her budget.
4. **In-Store Experience**: She visits a local H&M store, tries on the coat, and decides to buy it along with matching pants and an umbrella.

## Data Sources

### Customers
The customer table contains information such as age, club membership status, and newsletter frequency. There are over 1.3 million customers to provide recommendations for.

### Transactions
Transactional data represents a customer's interests, needs, and style, with over 31 million transactions recorded.

### Article Hierarchy
Articles are described using multiple dimensions, such as product group, department, section name, garment group, perceived color name, and graphical appearance.

### Article Descriptions
Detailed descriptions of articles provide additional information about products, which can be transformed into embeddings to enhance ML model performance.

### Article Images
Images of articles were included in the dataset, offering another dimension for feature generation.

## Conceptualization

### ML Model: General Need for Clothing

1. **Expectations**: The model should estimate the probability of a customer needing a particular clothing type in a given time period.
2. **Solution**: Use propensity-to-buy models and time-series seasonality forecasting models.

### ML Model: Customerâ€™s Style

1. **Expectations**: The model should sort articles within a product category based on how well they match a customer's style.
2. **Solution**: Generate features using image and text embeddings, then apply content-based and collaborative filtering models.

### ML Model: Available Stock / Lifetime of an Article

1. **Expectations**: Estimate the probability of an article being offered in a given week.
2. **Solution**: Use models to predict sales volume per article per week.

### ML Model: The Customer's Final Decision

1. **Concept**: Create a final-decision model that is an ensemble of all the individual models.
2. **Solution**: Use AutoML to generate final scores and validate the model.

## Final Concept

The solution involves generating features using multiple techniques, storing them in a feature store, and using an ensemble of ML models to generate recommendations. The expected input to the final ensemble model is a table with `customer_id`, `week_id`, and `article_id`, with columns representing results from various ML models.

## Summary

Our approach to the H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations competition involved understanding the decision-making process, generating relevant features, and applying a combination of ML models to create a robust recommendation system. The project highlights the importance of data-driven insights in predicting customer behavior and enhancing the shopping experience.
